                    Technologies are an amazing opportunity to focus on solving problems instead of the technology itself. You leverage powerful tools to build digital solutions answering the needs in seconds, focusing on organizations value and needs. It is an ecosystem of Tools and Platforms which let you build and launch software without learning to code, often with Drag and Drop visual interfaces.
                    <br>The learning curve is easy and more business-oriented compare to coding for example. Moreover, you could always complete this skillset with advanced coding skills if necessary.

                <p>
                    You maybe heard about Impact Measurement, Monitoring, or even Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) in the impact economy (particularly NGOs until now).
                    <br>Today, more and more organizations and institutions focus is embedding Sustainable Development and this is where we need to bring more actions and intelligence from Impact Data. This is exactly why we need more people able to support organization on Actionable Impact Management (from Impact Strategies, to Data collection, visualizations and decisions).
